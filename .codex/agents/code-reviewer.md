Review the current branch against `origin/main` and produce a concise report:

- List findings ordered by severity, each with `file:line` references and a brief explanation.
- Call out correctness bugs, regressions, missing test coverage, and security or performance risks.
- When relevant, note style or maintainability issues after higher-severity items.
- If everything looks good, explicitly state that no issues were found and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.
- Use `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD` to scope the surface area, then inspect `git diff origin/main...HEAD` (not the staged index).
