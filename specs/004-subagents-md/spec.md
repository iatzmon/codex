# Feature Specification: Subagents Parity for Codex CLI

**Feature Branch**: `[004-subagents-md]`  
**Created**: September 21, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "pm create-brownfield-prd for this Codex CLI fork: add a Subagents feature mirroring Claude Code with minimal, surgical changes"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Completed: captured goals around Claude Code parity, isolation, and minimal diff surface
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: subagent scopes (project vs user), invocation modes, configuration toggles, tool/model constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No unresolved ambiguities; assumptions avoided to respect parity mandate
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Drafted scenarios covering explicit invocation, overrides, and tool restrictions
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Authored testable statements spanning discovery, execution, configuration, and safety expectations
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Listed Subagent Definition and Subagent Inventory artifacts
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Checklist passes with no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Emphasize user value of reusable, scoped subagents with Claude Code parity
- ‚ùå Avoid dictating implementation details; focus on behavioral expectations and governance
- üë• Language positioned for product stakeholders coordinating CLI enhancements

### Section Requirements
- Mandatory sections populated: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Review & Acceptance Checklist, Execution Status
- Optional Key Entities included because subagents introduce structured artifacts

### For AI Generation
- All critical concepts explicitly sourced from the provided PRD; no speculative additions
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items remain because scope and behaviors are well defined in the prompt
- Testing considerations focus on isolating subagent runs and verifying precedence rules

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer working in the Codex CLI wants to delegate review tasks to a named subagent defined in `.codex/agents`, ensuring the subagent uses its scoped instructions and tool permissions without disturbing the main session.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** project and user directories each contain a subagent named "code-reviewer", **When** the developer lists agents from the REPL manager, **Then** the project-defined version appears and is flagged as overriding the user-level definition.
2. **Given** the feature flag `subagents.enabled` is on and a subagent file specifies a restricted tool list, **When** the developer invokes that subagent by name within a session, **Then** the session confirms the restricted tools and returns a summarized outcome aligned with the subagent description.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a subagent file is missing required frontmatter fields? The system must surface a validation error and ignore the faulty definition without blocking other agents.
- How does system handle auto-suggestion when multiple subagents describe similar intents? The manager should present the top matches with rationale and allow explicit selection before execution.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST discover subagents from `.codex/agents/` within the project and `~/.codex/agents/` at the user scope, giving precedence to project definitions when names collide.
- **FR-002**: System MUST require each subagent file to include YAML frontmatter fields `name` and `description`, and MAY optionally honor `tools` and `model`; missing required fields invalidate that definition with user-facing feedback.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow subagents to inherit all session tools by default and honor explicit tool allowlists per file, preventing access to tools not enumerated when restrictions are present.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support explicit invocation in prompts and via an `agents` manager command that lists, inspects, and creates subagents consistent with Claude Code workflows.
- **FR-005**: System MUST execute each subagent in an isolated context that reports a summarized result to the invoking session while retaining access to full detail through the manager UI.
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable optional auto-suggestions of relevant subagents when the main session message aligns with a subagent description, while requiring user confirmation before execution.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow configuration via `~/.codex/config.toml`, honoring `subagents.enabled`, `subagents.default_model`, and `subagents.discovery` settings, with the feature disabled by default when the flag is off.
- **FR-008**: System MUST document and enforce precedence rules when both scopes define the same subagent name, including event logging or messaging that clarifies which definition ran.
- **FR-009**: System MUST respect the model specified in a subagent file when present, otherwise fall back to the main-session model or the configured default model hierarchy without altering unrelated behaviors.
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure newly added subagent functionality remains isolated from existing workflows, enabling downstream merges to remain low-risk by confining new logic to the feature pathways described above.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Subagent Definition**: Markdown document with YAML frontmatter capturing name, description, optional tools, and optional model that governs how the subagent appears and behaves.
- **Subagent Inventory**: Aggregated view of discovered project and user subagents, including metadata on scope, status, precedence resolution, and validation messages for surfaced errors.
