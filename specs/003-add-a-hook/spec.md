# Feature Specification: Add Codex Hook System

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-a-hook`  
**Created**: September 20, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a hook system to Codex CLI, it should match the capabilities of the hook system Claude Code has - use web search to find information about Claude Codes hook system and what it can do
- analyze the codex codebase in ./codex-rs and look for an internal hook system and analyze its capabilities
- adapt claude codes hooks feature to codex capabilities"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Codex power users and administrators want deterministic control over safety, automation, and compliance workflows. They define lifecycle hooks once and expect Codex to invoke those hooks consistently (before and after tool use, on session changes, and around notifications) so they can enforce policy, enrich context, and trigger external systems without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a team configures a `PreToolUse` hook that denies shell commands touching production paths, **When** Codex prepares to run `rm -rf /var/www`, **Then** the hook must inspect the request, return a "deny" decision with human-readable feedback, block the tool call automatically, and surface that feedback to both the user and the agent transcript.
2. **Given** a user adds `PostToolUse` hooks scoped to Edit/Write tools, **When** Codex completes a multi-file edit, **Then** the hook must receive tool input/response JSON, run follow-up scripts (such as formatters or linters), and publish any hook output alongside the agent‚Äôs turn completion summary.
3. **Given** administrators register `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, and `Notification` hooks in shared policy files, **When** Codex starts, pauses, or requests approvals during a session, **Then** the appropriate hooks must fire with event-specific payloads so downstream systems log activity, preload context, or alert reviewers without user prompts.

### Edge Cases
- Hook timeouts or non-zero exits must fail safe: Codex should stop relying on the hook output, warn the user, and default to the conservative decision (block risky actions, continue session safely).
- Conflicting hook decisions (for example, one hook allows and another denies the same tool call) must follow the documented precedence order: managed policy hooks run first, then project-level hooks, then local user hooks; the first decisive result wins and Codex records the decision trail for users.
- Hooks that modify files or environment state must not create infinite loops (e.g., `PostToolUse` rewrite triggers new edits continually); Codex needs safeguards such as idempotency guidance and detection of rapid repeated triggers.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST expose lifecycle hook events aligned with Claude Code: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `SubagentStop`, `PreCompact`, `SessionStart`, and `SessionEnd`.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support layered configuration at Codex-wide managed policy, project, and local scopes so different teams can register hooks without overwriting each other; managed policy hooks evaluate first, then project-level hooks, then local user hooks, and the first decisive decision stands while later results are logged for transparency.
- **FR-003**: `PreToolUse` hooks MUST accept tool matchers (exact, wildcard, or pattern-based) and return decisions of `allow`, `ask`, or `deny`, with optional human-readable feedback surfaced to the user.
- **FR-004**: `PostToolUse` hooks MUST receive tool input and response data and may attach additional context or issue a `block` decision that requires Codex to revisit the work.
- **FR-005**: `UserPromptSubmit` hooks MUST be able to veto or augment user prompts before the agent processes them, including inserting additional context for successful prompts.
- **FR-006**: `Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks MUST be able to require follow-on work by returning `block` along with mandatory guidance so Codex continues with revised instructions.
- **FR-007**: `SessionStart` hooks MUST support source matchers (startup, resume, clear, compact) and allow injecting context or performing setup tasks before Codex interacts with the user.
- **FR-008**: `SessionEnd` hooks MUST capture exit reasons (clear, logout, prompt_input_exit, other) and enable clean-up or archival routines.
- **FR-009**: `Notification` hooks MUST fire whenever Codex emits approval prompts or idle reminders so teams can integrate external alerting or approval workflows.
- **FR-010**: `PreCompact` hooks MUST distinguish between manual and automatic compaction triggers to let teams audit or adjust compaction behavior.
- **FR-011**: Hooks MUST receive structured JSON input (including session identifier, working directory, transcript path, event name, `schemaVersion`, and event-specific fields) and may reply via exit codes or JSON payloads to control Codex behavior.
- **FR-012**: Hook contracts MUST require each hook to declare supported schema versions; Codex MUST warn on mismatches and refuse execution when compatibility cannot be guaranteed.
- **FR-013**: Exit code handling MUST follow Claude Code semantics: `0` succeeds, `2` blocks with automated feedback, and other non-zero codes surface errors without halting the session. JSON responses MUST allow `continue`, `stopReason`, `systemMessage`, and event-specific outputs.
- **FR-014**: Users MUST have tooling (CLI or UI) to list active hooks, view their source files, and inspect recent execution outcomes for auditing.
- **FR-015**: System MUST log hook executions (timestamp, event, decision, exit status, stderr/stdout summaries) so teams can satisfy compliance and debugging needs.
- **FR-016**: Administrators MUST be able to disable or constrain hooks in sandboxed or high-trust environments, including honoring approval policies that restrict automatic execution.
- **FR-017**: Existing `notify` command behavior MUST remain available, either by mapping to a `Notification` hook preset or by offering a migration path, to protect current workflows.
- **FR-018**: Documentation and onboarding content MUST outline hook capabilities, security implications, configuration locations, and sample policies for common tasks (formatting, approval escalation, compliance logging).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Hook Event**: Lifecycle checkpoint that Codex emits (name, trigger description, expected payload fields, supported decisions). Used to align Codex behavior with Claude Code capabilities.
- **Hook Definition**: User- or admin-authored rule containing event bindings, optional matchers, shell command(s), timeout settings, and execution scope metadata.
- **Hook Execution Record**: Audit artifact capturing invocation timestamp, session context, hook decision, outputs, errors, and continuation state for reporting and troubleshooting.
